|                           RS232 CONNECTOR                                |
 ==========================================================================

In order to play around with the RS232 connector, it has been muxed
between:
            - GPIO port P1.1 (TX) / P2.2 (RX)  -->  for TA_UART software project
            - the debug interface.             -->  for LEDS    software project
            - the simple hardware UART         -->  for HW_UART software project

The mux is controlled with the SW0/SW1 switches on the board:

            00 = debug interface
            01 = GPIO
            10 = simple hardware uart
            11 = debug interface
