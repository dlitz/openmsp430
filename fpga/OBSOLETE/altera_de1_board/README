This is OpenMSP430 core+peripherals implementation adapted for Altera DE1 board.

It is based on original Olivier's adaptation for Diligent S3 board, but has following distinctions:

1. Fixed 7segment core, since DE1 has non-muxed digits.
2. It is adapted for MegaWizard-generated 16-bit wide on-chip ROMs and RAMs.
3. Debug ROM write is removed (although it shouldn't be a problem to return it back).
   Anyway I haven't used any debug features.
4. As an alternative to the embedded synchronous RAM, there is ext_de1_sram module that
   allows core to access external on-board static RAM.
5. Core is configured to have non-standard ROM and RAM sizes (4kB and 1kB), so make
   sure the OpenMSP430_defines.v file is properly updated
6. There is new software project that uses custom linker script to compile for non-standard
   ROM and RAM sizes.

Any questions? lvd.mhm@gmail.com
