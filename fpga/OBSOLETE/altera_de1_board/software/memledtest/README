This project is for altera DE1 implementation of OpenMSP430 core and periphery.
It is adopted from original "leds" project.

It does simple things using two periodic interrupts (from watchdog and
from timerA), also it tests extensively RAM by creating some continuous
traffic with it.

It is tuned for non-standard sizes of ROM (4kB or 2kWords) and
RAM (1kB or 512 words), thus it has its own linker script (link.ld).
Also it generates *.mif as a final result to use in Quartus, which,
in turn, is generated from raw *.bin file instead of *.hex.
This is done because Q6.1 can't load byte-wise ihex to the
16bit-wide ROM.

Warning! You should change the OpenMSP430_defines.v file to adopt for
non-standard memory sizes.

mifwrite.exe is compiled for win32; you can find its source
in tools/bin
