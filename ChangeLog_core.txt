2015-11-17 [r211]  

	* Add custom printf function to reduce program memory footprint

	  simulators in mixed VHDL/Verilog environment. - Update
	  oscillators enable generation to relax a critical timing paths in
	  the ASIC version. - Add option to scan fix inverted clocks in the
	  ASIC version (disabled by default as this is supported by most
	  tools).

2015-07-08 [r204]  

	* Fix DMA interface RTL merge problem (defines got wrong values).

	* Update hardware breakpoint unit with the followings: - fixed
	  hardware breakpoint bug with CALL instructions. - modified data
	  read watchpoint behavior to also trigger with read/modify/write
	  instructions. - removed unused ports.

2013-01-30 [r174]  

	* Cleanup dmem_wr generation logic. Important note: this is not a
	  bug fix, only beautification.

2012-10-15 [r154]  

	* The serial debug interface now supports the I2C protocol (in
	  addition to the UART)

2012-07-22 [r151]  

	* Add possibility to configure custom Program, Data and Peripheral
	  memory sizes.

	* Update FPGA examples with the POP.B bug fix

2011-12-16 [r128]  

	* Fixed CALL x(SR) bug (see Bugtracker
	  http://opencores.org/bug,view,2111 )

2011-10-05 [r122]  

	* Add coverage report generation (NCVERILOG only) Add support for
	  the ISIM Xilinx simulator.

2011-06-23 [r117]  

	* To facilitate commercial adoption of the openMSP430, the core has
	  moved to a modified BSD license.

2011-05-29 [r115]  

	* Add linker script example.

2011-05-21 [r112]  

	* Modified comment.

2011-05-20 [r111]  

	* Re-organized the "openMSP430_defines.v" file. Re-defined the
	  CPU_ID register of the debug interface (in particular to support
	  custom user versioning). Added RTL configuration possibility to
	  expand the peripheral address space from 512B (0x0000 to 0x0200)
	  to up to 32kB (0x0000 to 0x8000). As a consequence the per_addr
	  bus width goes from 8 to 14 bits and the peripherals address
	  decoders have been updated accordingly.

2011-03-25 [r106]  

	* Separated the Timer A defines from the openMSP430 ones. Added the
	  "dbg_en" port in order to allow a separate reset of the debug
	  interface. Added the "core_en" port (when cleared, the CPU will
	  stop execution, the dbg_freeze signal will be set and the aclk &
	  smclk will be stopped). Renamed "per_wen" to "per_we" to prevent
	  confusion with active low signals. Removed to missing unused
	  flops when the DBG_EN is not defined (thanks to Mihai
	  contribution).

2011-03-10 [r105]  

	* Removed dummy memory read access for the MOV/PUSH/CALL/RETI
	  instructions. These were not problematic but this is simply
	  cleaner that way.

2011-03-05 [r103]  

	* Removed the timescale from all RTL files. Added possibility to
	  exclude the "includes" statements from the RTL.

2011-03-04 [r102]  

	* Fixed bug reported by Mihai ( http://opencores.org/bug,view,1955
	  ). The following PUSH instructions are now working as expected: -
	  indexed mode: PUSH x(R1) - indirect register mode: PUSH @R1 -
	  indirect autoincrement: PUSH @R1+

2011-03-04 [r101]  

	* Cosmetic change in order to prevent an X propagation whenever
	  executing a byte instruction with an uninitialized memory
	  location as source.

2011-02-28 [r99]  

	* Small fix for CVER simulator support.

2011-02-28 [r98]  

	* Added support for VCS verilog simulator. VPD and TRN waveforms
	  can now be generated.

2011-02-24 [r95]  

	* Update some test patterns for the additional simulator supports.

2011-02-24 [r94]  

	* Thanks to Mihai-Costin Manolescu's contribution, the simulation
	  scripts now support the following simulators: - Icarus Verilog -
	  Cver - Verilog-XL - NCVerilog - Modelsim

2011-02-20 [r91]  

	* Fixed bug when an IRQ arrives while CPU is halted through the
	  serial debug interface. This bug is CRITICAL for people using
	  working with interrupts and the Serial Debug Interface.

2011-01-28 [r86]  

	* Update serial debug interface test patterns to make them work
	  with all program memory configurations.

2011-01-28 [r85]  

	* Diverse RTL cosmetic updates.

2011-01-23 [r84]  

	* Update SRAM model in the core testbench to prevent the IEEE
	  warning when running simulations. Update watchdog to fix NMI
	  synchronisation problem. Add synchronizers for the PUC signal in
	  the debug interface.

2010-12-05 [r80]  

	* Create initial version of the Actel FPGA implementation example.

2010-11-23 [r79]  

	* Update the GPIO peripheral to fix a potential synchronization
	  issue.

2010-11-18 [r76]  

	* Add possibility to simulate C code within the "core" environment.

2010-08-28 [r74]  

	* Update serial debug interface to support memories with a size
	  which is not a power of 2. Update the software tools accordingly.

2010-08-03 [r73]  

	* Update all bash scripts headers with "#!/bin/bash" instead of
	  "#!/bin/sh". This will prevent compatibility problems in systems
	  where bash isn't the default shell.

2010-08-01 [r72]  

	* Expand configurability options of the program and data memory
	  sizes.

2010-03-07 [r67-68]  

	* Update synthesis scripts with the hardware multiplier support.

	* Added 16x16 Hardware Multiplier.

2010-03-07 [r66]  

	* The peripheral templates are now under BSD license. Developers of
	  new peripherals based on these templates won't have to disclose
	  their code.

2010-02-24 [r65]  

	* Add possibility to disable waveform dumping by setting the
	  OMSP_NODUMP environment variable to 1.

2010-02-14 [r64]  

	* Add Actel synthesis environment for size and speed analysis.

2010-02-14 [r63]  

	* Add Altera synthesis environment for size and speed analysis.

2010-02-14 [r62]  

	* Add Xilinx synthesis environment for size&speed analysis.

2010-02-03 [r60]  

	* Cleanup of the PC (R0) generation logic. Formal equivalence was
	  shown between the new and old code with Synopsys' Formality (to
	  make sure that nothing has been broken :-P ).

2010-02-01 [r58]  

	* Update the debug hardware breakpoint verification patterns to
	  reflect the latest design updates.

2010-02-01 [r57]  

	* Update design to exclude the range mode from the debug hardware
	  breakpoint units. As this feature is not used by GDB, it has been
	  disabled in order to improve the timings and save a bit of
	  area/utilisation. Note that if required, this feature can be
	  re-enabled through the `HWBRK_RANGE define located in the
	  "openMSP430_defines.v" file.

2010-01-28 [r56]  

	* Update Design Compiler Synthesis scripts.

2010-01-27 [r55]  

	* Add a "sandbox" test pattern to play around with the simulation
	  :-P

2010-01-27 [r54]  

	* Update FPGA projects with the combinatorial loop fixed.

2010-01-27 [r53]  

	* Fixed the following combinatorial timing loop: 1- irq_detect
	  (omsp_frontend) 2- decode (omsp_frontend) 3- dbg_swbrk (omsp_dbg)
	  4- halt_flag_set (omsp_dbg) 6- dbg_halt_cmd (omsp_dbg) 7-
	  irq_detect (omsp_frontend) Without this fix, problem could occur
	  whenever an IRQ request arrives during a software breakpoint
	  instruction fetch.

2009-12-29 [r34]  

	* To avoid potential conflicts with other Verilog modules in bigger
	  projects, the openMSP430 sub-modules have all been renamed with
	  the "omsp_" prefix.

2009-12-29 [r33]  

	* In order to avoid confusion, the following changes have been
	  implemented to the Verilog code: - renamed the "rom_*" ports and
	  defines to "pmem_*" (program memory). - renamed the "ram_*" ports
	  and defines to "dmem_*" (data memory). In addition, in order to
	  prevent potential conflicts with the Verilog defines of other
	  IPs, a Verilog undefine file has been created.

2009-08-30 [r23]  

	* Renamed the "openMSP430.inc" file to "openMSP430_defines.v" &
	  added the "timescale.v" file. In order to follow the same
	  structure as other OpenCores projects, the timescale and the
	  defines are now included from within the Verilog files (using the
	  `include construct).

2009-08-04 [r19]  

	* added SVN property for keywords

2009-08-04 [r18]  

	* Updated headers with SVN info

2009-08-04 [r17]  

	* Updated header with SVN info
