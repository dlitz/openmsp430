This floppy disk contains the source code of the Dhrystone benchmark
(version 2.1) in three languages:

Files containing the Ada version (*.s: Specifications, *.b: Bodies):

  d_global.s
  d_main.b
  d_pack_1.b
  d_pack_1.s
  d_pack_2.b
  d_pack_2.s

  (The file names have been abbreviated to 8 characters plus extension
   for MS-DOS)

Files containing the C version (*.h: Header File, *.c: C Modules)

  dhry.h
  dhry_1.c
  dhry_2.c
  
File containing the Pascal version:

  dhry.p

The file RATIONALE contains the article 

  "Dhrystone Benchmark: Rationale for Version 2 and Measurement Rules"

which has been published, together with the C source code (Version 2.0),
in SIGPLAN Notices vol. 23, no. 8 (Aug. 1988), pp. 49-62.
This article explains all changes that have been made for Version 2,
compared with the version of the original publication
in Communications of the ACM vol. 27, no. 10 (Oct. 1984), pp. 1013-1030.
It also contains "ground rules" for benchmarking with Dhrystone
which should be followed by everyone who uses the program and publishes
Dhrystone results.

Compared with the Version 2.0 published in SIGPLAN Notices, Version 2.1
contains a few corrections that have been made after Version 2.0 was
distriobuted over the UNIX network Usenet. These small differences between
Version 2.0 and 2.1 should not affect execution time measurements.
For those who want to compare the exact contents of both versions,
the file "dhry_c.dif" contains the differences between the two versions,
as generated by a file comparison of the corresponding files with the
UNIX utility "diff".

Recipients of this floppy disk who perform measurements are asked
to send measurement results to the author and/or to Rick Richardson.
Rick Richardson publishes regularly Dhrystone results on the UNIX network
Usenet. For submissions of results to him (preferably by electronic mail,
see address in the program header), he has provided a form which is contained
in the file "submit.frm".
